To better understand this pandemic, we believe, it is worthwhile giving a thorough study of the origin and the spread of the pandemic. In this project, which is initially inspired by the graph above, we would like to investigate a few new and controversial opinions regarding to the pandemic. By looking into the US annual death rate, it is easy to realize that the death rate has an increasing trend in last decade. We do not observe a significant spike in 2020. It seems that COVID19 did not cause a lot more deaths than what we expected (or what had been reported). If we pay a bit more attention to the gradient at 2020, the gradient is less than the previous year, which is quite counter-intuitive. After doing some researches, we found a few interesting beliefs that may justify our findings. The beliefs are as follows: The COVID pandemic had actually started before 2020 in the US under the cover of winter flu. The pandemic became not as killing after summer 2020. Caucasians (the US majority) are less prone to the virus. We would like to investigate the first two beliefs by comparing death counts and extend the last problem to a more general one: does race affect infection rates. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources All the data we use come from websites with .gov domain name for the sake of accuracy and reliability. Data are either collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDV) or John Hopkins University (JHU). There are several notable points about our datasets: There are numerous reliable datasets recording COVID related information like infection rates, death rate etc, but we chose entirely different datasets (approach) by analyzing our first two problems from the perspective of all-cause death counts. We do not directly use COVID death counts as we believe that data may be deceiving: that data only give the number of people who die with COVID, but COVID may not be the leading cause of death (studies have shown that most people with COVID actually die from COVID complications). Therefore, we directly compare monthly death counts. This is kind of doing an AB test while holding everything else constant or in similar states except for the existence of the pandemic. As such, our data would help answer our questions. For the analysis of death counts, we have two datasets, namely \"Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv\" and \"Monthly_provisional_counts_of_deaths_by_age_group__sex__and_race_ethnicity_for_select_causes_of_death__2019-2020.csv\" from two websites. Dataset 1 directly gives death count per month while the 2nd one reports monthly death count by age, sex and race. It is easy to transform the second dataset into the form of the first one by taking summation on different groups of data. After such data transformation, we found that the two datasets give almost the same number of monthly death counts in 2019, which is the only overlapped data. We believe this is a strong evidence of consistency and reliability.

We perform similar things to \"Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv\" dataset Month and Year are given separately, in order to give a plot where date is the x-axis, we need to merge these two columns and convert data into date format. Time series models give predicted data as time series objects. We convert that into normal data frame for plotting. In order to plot predicted data and actual data as a continuous graph, we merge these 2 datasets/data frame. We have two data sets, one records data from 2014 to 2019, the other records data from 2019 to 2020. In order to make a continuous graph, we merge these two datasets/data frame.

All missing values come from AllCause(death counts) column. To deal with these missing values, we divide all the data that do not have missing values into groups by their sex, race and age group and then calculate mean within each group. Eventually, we update all missing values to the mean of their respective group. ## [1] FALSE After updates, there is no more missing values.

As the time series model is the foundation of our project, we would use it to predict death counts if there were pandemic (what would the data look like in a normal year). The predictions give us the baseline to compare with. Therefore, we want the predictions to be accurate and our model to be statistically reasonable. Therefore, we would analyze the time series model using some graphs. Firstly, we want to check if the assumptions of stationarity and seasonality for time series hold. The decomposition of the time series plot shows trend, seasonal effects and white noise (randomness). As evident from the decomposition, the data exhibit: 1.Strong seasonality with almost constant seasonal effects on a period of 12. Logically, the constant seasonal effect also makes sense, suggesting that more people die in winter perhaps because of winter flu and temperature. 2.Trend is generally increasing with a few exceptions at 2015.6 and 2018.6. The trend agrees with what we have discovered in the introduction: death counts/rate is increasing in the past decade. 3.There is no clusters or patterns. White noise is randomly distributed with a mean of 0. Stationarity and seasonality hold. Time series plot seems like a good approach and from here we develop some intuition that when comparing death counts, we we should take into account that there are more deaths in winter than in summer. ## ## ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] with drift : 992.9256 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 975.9687 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] : 1006.234 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] with drift : 978.972 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 986.8855 ## ARIMA(2,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 977.8282 ## ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 976.5776 ## ARIMA(2,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 980.3347 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] : 979.3249 ## ## Best model: ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift ## [1] TRUE ## Series: tsData ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift ## ## Coefficients: ## ar1 sar1 drift ## 0.5195 -0.3903 361.1227 ## s.e. 0.1325 0.1546 106.1293 ## ## sigma^2 estimated as 33457901: log likelihood=-483.52 ## AIC=975.04 AICc=975.97 BIC=982.52 The automatically generated model is ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12]. The ACF and PACF plots agree with that model and therefore we will be using this simple model to predict what would death counts look like if there were no pandemic Visually, the predicted data and the actual data look consistent. The predictions capture model trend and seasonality. 5.1.2 Comparison and Analysis The dark blue line is a predicted line which simulates the death counts if there were no pandemic. We have predicted 2019 death counts to see if the pandemic had started before 2020 under the under cover of winter flu. Logically, the earlier in 2019, the less likely the pandemic had started. Therefore, the early data in 2019 could also serve as a validation set. Before Nov 2019, the two graphs are similar in terms of shape and values. This reassures that the fitted model is accurate. Based on this plot, we have three observations: 1. Predictions always overestimated death counts before Nov 2019. The actual death counts surpassed prediction in Nov 2019 and the number kept increasing until May 2020 while it was expected to drop according to predictions. It seems the actual line has deviated from predictions since Nov 2019, which supports our first belief that the pandemic had started before 2020. 2. The increasing trend in actual death counts was flattened in Jun and Jul 2020. It seems that pandemic became not as killing in summer. Yet, the difference between the two curves were still increasing and we should also remember that death counts is generally expected to be lower in summer. Therefore, we should take this into account and plot more graphs. 3. The death counts rise again after July 2020. We cannot conclude for the second belief. In order to further investigate our 2nd and 3rd observations made above, we use another graph to take a closer look at our data by month. This plot groups data by month, that is plotting 12 graphs according to 12 months. This removes month-induced effects. Based on figure 2, we have another 3 observations: 1. The death counts in Feb and Mar 2020 were actually the same as predicted values. More importantly, we actual death counts in Jan 2020 is much less than the predicted. This not only rejects the first belief, but also conflicts with figure 1 which shows that death counts in Jan, Feb and Mar 2020 were more than the predicted. 2. From May - Oct 2020, the death counts were greater than the predicted. However, the gradient of the red curve or differences between the two curves are less. 3. Death counts surge again after Oct 2020. Therefore, we could almost conclude that the pandemic was not as killing in summer and only in summer. As for the conflicts we found in the first observation, we will investigate that using another plot. This plots the raw data without any smoothing. Clearly, actual death counts were always less than the predicted before March 2020. Figure 1 gives us the illusion that actual death counts surpassed the predicted since Nov 2019 as the actual data in Nov 2019, Dec 2019, Jan 2020, Feb 2020 and Mar 2020 were pulled by the very big number in April 2020 in smoothing. Therefore, the pandemic did not start before 2020. Based on only data and plots, its started after Mar 2020 which agrees with official records. The first belief is not true. 5.2 Belief 3 "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
