To better understand this pandemic, we believe, it is worthwhile giving a thorough study of the origin and the spread of the pandemic. In this project, which is initially inspired by the graph above, we would like to investigate a few new and controversial opinions regarding to the pandemic. By looking into the US annual death rate, it is easy to realize that the death rate has an increasing trend in last decade. We do not observe a significant spike in 2020. It seems that COVID19 did not cause a lot more deaths than what we expected (or what had been reported). If we pay a bit more attention to the gradient at 2020, the gradient is less than the previous year, which is quite counter-intuitive. After doing some researches, we found a few interesting beliefs that may justify our findings. The beliefs are as follows: The COVID pandemic had actually started before 2020 in the US under the cover of winter flu. The pandemic became not as killing after summer 2020. Some specific groups of people (the white) are less prone to the virus. We would like to investigate the first two beliefs by comparing death counts and extend the last problem to a more general one: What are the factors that may affect death rate. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources All the data we use come from websites with .gov domain name for the sake of accuracy and reliability. Data are either collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDV) or John Hopkins University (JHU). There are several notable points about our datasets: There are numerous reliable datasets recording COVID related information like infection rates, death rate etc, but we chose entirely different datasets (approach) by analyzing our first two problems from the perspective of all-cause death counts. We do not directly use COVID death counts as we believe that that data may be deceiving: that data only gives the number of people who die with COVID, but COVID may not be the leading cause of death (studies have shown that most people with COVID actually die from COVID complications). Therefore, we directly compare monthly death counts. This is kind of doing an AB test while holding everything else constant or in similar states except for the existence of the pandemic. As such, our data would help answer our questions. For the analysis of death counts, we have two datasets, namely \"Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv\" and \"Monthly_provisional_counts_of_deaths_by_age_group__sex__and_race_ethnicity_for_select_causes_of_death__2019-2020.csv\" from two websites. After we take summation on different age, sex and race for the 2nd dataset, both datasets give almost the same monthly death counts for the year of 2019, the only overlapped data. We believe this is a strong evidence of consistency and reliability. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation \"AH_Monthly_provisional_counts_of_deaths_by_age_group__sex__and_race_ethnicity_for_select_causes_of_death.csv\" dataset has a lot of irrelevant information, we extract AllCause, Month, Year columns for plotting and sex, AgeGroup, Race for data cleaning. We perform similar things to \"Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv\" dataset Month and Year are given separately, in order to give a plot where date is the x-axis, we need to merge these two columns and convert data into date format. Time series models give predicted data as time series objects. We convert that into normal data frame for plotting. In order to plot predicted data and actual data as a continuous graph, we merge these 2 datasets/data frame. We have two data sets, one records data from 2014 to 2019, the other records data from 2019 to 2020. In order to make a continuous graph, we merge these two datasets/data frame. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Total number of missing data by columns ## AllCause Date.Of.Death.Year Date.Of.Death.Month ## 151 0 0 ## AgeGroup Sex Race.Ethnicity ## 0 0 0 Total number of rows: ## [1] 3000 There are 151 missing data in 3000 rows, around 5 percent missing rates. All missing values come from AllCause column. To deal with these missing values, we divide all the data that do not have missing values into groups by their sex, race and age group and then calculate mean within each group. Eventually, we update all missing values to the mean of their respective group. ## [1] FALSE After updates, there is no more missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Time Series Analysis 5.2 comparison", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Time Series Analysis Intuitively, death counts per month can be plotted and modeled by time series since data are collected on a monthly basis. As the time series model is the foundation of our project, we would use it to predict death counts if there were pandemic (what would the data look like in a normal year). The predictions give us the baseline to compare with. Therefore, we want the predictions to be accurate and our model to be statistically reasonable. Therefore, we would analyze these using some graphs. Firstly, we want to check if the assumptions of stationarity and seasonality for time series hold. The decomposition of the time series plot shows trend, seasonal effects and white noise (randomness). As evident from the decomposition, the data exhibit strong seasonality with almost constant seasonal effects on a period of 12 and the trend is generally increasing with a few exceptions at 2015.6 and 2018.6. The trend agrees what we have discovered in the introduction: death counts/rate is increasing in the past decade. Logically, the constant seasonal effect also makes sense, suggesting that more people die in winter perhaps because of winter flu and temperature. Time series plot seems like a good approach and from here we develop some intuition that when comparing death counts, we we should take into account that there are more deaths in winter than in summer. ## ## ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] with drift : 992.9256 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 975.9687 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] : 1006.234 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,0)[12] with drift : 978.972 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 986.8855 ## ARIMA(2,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 977.8282 ## ARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 976.5776 ## ARIMA(2,0,1)(1,1,0)[12] with drift : 980.3347 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] : 979.3249 ## ## Best model: ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift ## Series: tsData ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12] with drift ## ## Coefficients: ## ar1 sar1 drift ## 0.5195 -0.3903 361.1227 ## s.e. 0.1325 0.1546 106.1293 ## ## sigma^2 estimated as 33457901: log likelihood=-483.52 ## AIC=975.04 AICc=975.97 BIC=982.52 The automatically generated model is ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[12].
