# Data sources

All the data we use come from websites with ".gov" domain name for the sake of accuracy and reliability. Data are either collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDV) or John Hopkins University (JHU).

There are several notable points about our datasets:

1. There are numerous reliable datasets recording COVID related information like infection rates, death rate etc, but we chose entirely different datasets (approach) by analyzing our first two problems from the perspective of all-cause death counts. We do not directly use COVID death counts as we believe  that data may be deceiving: that data only give the number of people who die with COVID, but COVID may not be the leading cause of death (studies have shown that most people with COVID actually die from COVID complications). Therefore, we directly compare monthly death counts. This is kind of doing an AB test while holding everything else constant or in similar states except for the existence of the pandemic. As such, our data would help answer our questions.

2. For the analysis of death counts, we have two datasets, namely "Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv" and "Monthly_provisional_counts_of_deaths_by_age_group__sex__and_race_ethnicity_for_select_causes_of_death__2019-2020.csv" from two websites. Dataset 1 directly gives death count per month while the 2nd one reports monthly death count by age, sex and race. It is easy to transform the second dataset into the form of the first one by taking summation on different groups of data. After such data transformation, we found that the two datasets give almost the same number of monthly death counts in 2019, which is the only overlapped data. We believe this is a strong evidence of consistency and reliability.


```{R}
df = read.csv("Monthly_Counts_of_Deaths_by_Select_Causes__2014-2019.csv")
#df$time = paste(df$Year, df$Month, sep= '.')
df = df %>% select(All.Cause, Month,  Year)
df = df[order(df$Year, df$Month),]
df = df[df$Year <= 2018,]
```
```{r}
df_2020 = read.csv("AH_Monthly_provisional_counts_of_deaths_by_age_group__sex__and_race_ethnicity_for_select_causes_of_death.csv")
```
